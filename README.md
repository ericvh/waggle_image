## Linux images for Single Board Computers in Waggle Nodes: 

The waggle nodes currently use [Hardkernel (HK)](https://www.hardkernel.com/main/shop/good_list.php?lang=en) supplied [C1+](https://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G143703355573) and [XU4](https://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G143452239825) single board computers as Nodecontroller and Edge-processor respectively. These systems run a Linux operating system based on Ubuntu distribution. This repository deals with creating working versions of the Linux images for the C1+ and XU4 devices deployed in Waggle Nodes. The step-by-step process of image creation is available [here](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/waggle_image/blob/master/build_image_docs/README.md).
